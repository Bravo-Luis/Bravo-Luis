### <a href="https://github.com/Bravo-Luis/TrusteeHTML"> TrusteeHTML </a>
TrusteeHTMl is an extension of the existing Trustee package (A model-agnostic interpretability framework that promotes transparency, explainability, and reproducibility in evaluating black-box machine learning models). Developed during a research program under UCSB's System and Networking Lab, where we mainly worked to enhance and test the use cases of the Trustee Package, TrusteeHTML was a side project assigned to us to explore the creation of a more accessible and shareable format of the Trust Report Class in the Trustee Package, we also explored the usage of OpenAI's ChatGPT api in the analysis of the Trust Report.
