### TrusteeHTML
TrusteeHTMl is an extension of the existing Trustee package (A model-agnostic interpretability framework that promotes transparency, explainability, and reproducibility in evaluating black-box machine learning models). Developed during a research program under UCSB's System and Networking Lab, where we mainly worked to enhance and test the use cases of the Trustee Package, TrusteeHTML was a side project assigned to use to explore the creation of a more accessible and shareable ouput of the Trust Report Class in the Trustee Package, we also explored the usage of OpenAI's ChatGPT api in the analysis of the output of the Trust Report Class.
