### <a href="https://github.com/Bravo-Luis/TrusteeHTML"> TrusteeHTML </a>
TrusteeHTMl is an extension of the existing Trustee package (A model-agnostic interpretability framework that promotes transparency, explainability, and reproducibility in evaluating black-box machine learning models). Developed during a research program under UCSB's System and Networking Lab, where we mainly worked to enhance and test the use cases of the Trustee Package, TrusteeHTML was a side project assigned to us to explore the creation of a more accessible and shareable format of the Trust Report Class in the Trustee Package, we also explored the usage of OpenAI's ChatGPT api in the analysis of the Trust Report.

### <a href="https://github.com/Bravo-Luis/detecting_pauses"> Detecting Video Playback States </a>
Detecting Video Playback States is an innovative project aimed at analyzing network packet traces to identify different states of YouTube video playback. Developed as part of my work in special coursework on machine learning for networking, the project harnesses the capabilities of the netUnicorn platform, Selenium automation, and machine learning techniques. I focused on creating a comprehensive dataset by collecting and analyzing network traffic patterns during various playback states, including playing, pausing, and buffering. The project highlights the use of Python for data collection and processing, feature engineering to capture nuanced aspects of streaming, and the implementation of a RandomForestClassifier for state detection. My results showcase the potential of machine learning in improving streaming quality monitoring and offering a deeper understanding of network behavior in video streaming contexts.

## <a href="https://github.com/Bravo-Luis/TabGroups"> TabGroups </a>
A chrome extension I designed quickly for my own use, which I published to the chrome web store. This extension allows users to create groups of urls that are organized by color and can all be opened with the click of a button. The main purpose of this application is productivity and organization while using Google Chrome.
